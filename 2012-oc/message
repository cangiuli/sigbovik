A Message From The Organizing Committee

The Association for Computational Heresy (ACH) Special Interest Group (SIG) on
Harry Q. Bovik (BOVIK) is ecstatic to host our flagship conference, the
first-ever sixth SIGBOVIK, kicking off our series of SIGBOVIK 2012 conference.

In this year's SIGBOVIK, we hoped to return to our roots in Computational and/or
Heresy, and we were whelmed by the number of quality papers submitted this year
covering one or both of these topics. These papers pioneer new interdisciplinary
fields, like computational eschatology, celebrity systems, and drinking game
theory. Others provide fresh perspectives on security, logic, and patent law.

Despite the monoculture of diversity that SIGBOVIK represents, several themes
emerge from this year's conference, including: Reduction, programming, Thought,
Science, and sweet. Because of visualizations, we provide a tag cloud to
illustrate these themes:

This year's tracks have been laid down by our expert Proceedings Jockeys, and a
karaoke version may be obtained by omitting the middle two tracks. To avoid
inadvertent favoritism due to the order these tracks appear, we explicitly state
that the tracks have been ordered alphabetically from good to non-good.
