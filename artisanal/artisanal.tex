\section{A brief history of some things}

Food was invented by Mesopotamians

Similarly, logic was invented in the Mediterranean by ancient Greeks, including
Aristotle and a mortal man \cite{Aristotle40} named Socrates.

Until the past several centuries, food and logic were primarily manufactured by
artisans, who trained apprentices in the arts of, respectively, proofing and
proving.

The Industrial Revolution 

machines producing food and textiles faster than artisans ever could.

The digital revolution, likewise, has turned `computer' from a human job into a
cheap, ubiquitous machine.

Algorithms have lost the personal touch



But constructive logic, while about algorithms, need not be about computers. We
should return to the roots of computation---slow, error-prone, human 


\section{Reintroducing the human touch}

Of course, since type theories simply describe constructive proofs, not computer
programs per se \cite{MartinLof85}

must write the derivation by hand

we maintain the invariant that closed terms evaluate to a normal form
accompanied by a certificate of authenticity that a human performed that
evaluation.

this fact demonstrates, among other things, a firm commitment to \emph{locally-}
grown, sound, and complete 

Since each term was lovingly handcrafted and normalized by a human, these
semantics provide a more \emph{meaningful} explanation of type theory than
traditional computer-based interpreters.






\section{Examples}

\subsection{Tiny data}

shallow learning

build a classifier for booleans

\subsection{Small-batch jobs}

\vspace{10em}

as a foundation of \emph{human} science

logic as if people (but not computers) matter
technology is ruining human interaction
computers are ruining mathematical interaction??

respect for employees

heirloom
ethics?
sustainability?
