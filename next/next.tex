\title{The Next 700 Type Systems}

\maketitle

Type systems classify programs in a way that enables compositional reasoning
about their behavior. As a result, type systems have found a place as one of the
major organizing principles of modern programming languages; much programming
language research focuses on new ways of classifying programs in order to
capture more sophisticated invariants, including dependent, gradual, refinement,
linear, intersection, and existential types.

However, I feel that modern type systems focus too narrowly on
\emph{classification}, which is but one of the twenty-one definitions of the
noun \emph{type} in the Oxford English Dictionary. This myopic view of types has
impeded the vast majority of the possible subdisciplines of type theory, as
depicted in \Cref{fig:pie-chart}.

In the remainder of this paper, we describe a family of unimplemented type
systems that is intended to span differences of meaning by a group of disparate
frameworks \citep{landin66}.

\paragraph{A pattern stamped onto the face of a coin.}

In this sense, type systems are methods of stamping patterns on coins. The
earliest type systems required manually hammering a piece of metal between two
dies. Improvements in metalworking and industrial technologies has enabled
extensive automation in modern type systems. A recent theoretical advance in
type systems occurred during the 2013 United States debt-ceiling crisis, in
which some economists suggested that the United States Treasury could mint a \$1
trillion platinum coin in order to keep the government afloat without raising
the debt ceiling \citep{matthews13}.

\paragraph{An imperial edict released by Emperor Constans II in AD 648
prohibiting discussion of monothelitism.}

The Type of Constans was a ban on the debate between monothelitism and
dyothelitism---whether Jesus Christ, having both divine and human nature,
possessed a single will, or two wills (divine and human).

In fact, traditional type systems are already ideal for restricting inquiry into
the nature of things; recall, for instance, the fable of Professors Descartes
and Bessel in \citet{reynolds83}. To a programming language researcher, it is
clear that the Type of Constans is parametrically polymorphic in the will of
Christ, and the prohibition of discussion is simply a free theorem
\citep{wadler89}.
