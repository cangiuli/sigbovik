\title{The Next 700 Type Systems}

\maketitle

Type systems classify programs in a way that enables compositional reasoning
about their behavior. As a result, type systems have found a place as one of the
major organizing principles of modern programming languages; much programming
language research focuses on new ways of classifying programs in order to
capture more sophisticated invariants, including dependent, gradual, refinement,
linear, intersection, and existential types.

However, I feel that modern type systems focus too narrowly on
\emph{classification}, which is but one of the twenty-one definitions of the
noun \emph{type} in the Oxford English Dictionary. This myopic view of types has
impeded the vast majority of the possible subdisciplines of type theory, as
depicted in \Cref{fig:pie-chart}.

In the remainder of this paper, we describe a family of unimplemented type
systems that is intended to span differences of meaning by a group of disparate
frameworks \cite{landin66}.
